#Overview
This project involves building a simple web-based game and setting up a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using AWS services. The CD pipeline ensures that any changes made to the gameâ€™s code are automatically tested, built, and deployed to the live environment with minimal manual intervention. This approach allows for rapid iteration and ensures that new features and bug fixes are delivered to users quickly and reliably.
